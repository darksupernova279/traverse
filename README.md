Traverse is an automation framework built from the ground up. Its focus is on scalability, adaptability and maintainability. Although this started as a personal project it's built to the point of being introduced as a production-ready framework. It handles GUI / API and DB tests but also reporting and monitoring. The system is built to easily be modified and changed to expand the scope and ultimately build a solution to fit any need in the software industry (That is the goal).

The idea of Traverse or Test Traverse is to give the engineer complete control over the automation framework. Every product, every team, every organisation works differently. There is no one-size-fits-all for automation. In Traverse, the framework is built to be as custom as possible. Making it configurable and modular means the engineer can change its settings to suit their needs and control the outcomes or scale them as needed. The framework is just that, a framework, providing automation and QA engineers a foundation to build on as they see fit. This is not to say rookies cannot jump in and start automating. There is no requirement to configure, integrate or expand anything. You can use selenium directly in your tests or for API / DB tests there are utilities and the requests package in python ready for action.
